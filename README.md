# 📘 Programming Foundations – Exercises

This repository contains solutions and practice programs for the **exercises** from Tony Gaddis’ book *Starting Out with Python*. Each chapter folder mirrors the structure of the book and includes short Python scripts that demonstrate and reinforce programming concepts.
